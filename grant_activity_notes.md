- Discussed initial API possibilities with Mike
- Decided to start with a dump of the engine data with a column containing the prediction. I will use that to start exploring how to visualize the sensor data over time.
- Mike sent me the data dump.
- Current idea for the API: one endpoint that gets me back all sensor data for an engine over time, prediction over time is a column within that engine data (won't need to make any additional calls).
